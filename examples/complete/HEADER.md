# Complete example

The full appliable surface: a Linux scale set joined to a private load balancer backend pool (the
private-lb module) with an Application Health extension, automatic instance repair, termination
notification, a data disk, user_data, and accelerated networking, plus a Windows scale set with a
generated password and timezone. Spot capacity, mixed-size sku profiles, and rolling upgrades are
covered by the mocked tests instead: legal to apply, but hostage to spot capacity and upgrade
timing in a short-lived E2E. The environment comes from the Terraform workspace
(`terraform.workspace`), not a variable. Run it with `just e2e complete`, which applies the stack
then always destroys it.
